    <p style={{textIndent: '70px', marginLeft: '20%', marginRight: '20%'}}> Most AI art datasets are created by scraping the web for images and their descriptions. Then, they use a neural network to measure the similarity between the image's description and the image itself, and discard any description-image pairs that don't match well. We turn your art into a transferrable adversarial example by making slight changes that fool neural networks into misclassifying your art, so it will be silently dropped from large datasets. In other words, we minimize the similarity between your art and its current caption, and we maximize the similarity between your art and whatever you want neural networks to see. If you look closely at the nose of the cloaked shark, you'll see tiny red specks; those are the changes we make to protect your art.</p>

    <p style={{textIndent: '70px', marginLeft: "5%", marginRight: "5%"}}>  <b>What is the best way to use NeuralCloak?</b></p>
    <p style={{marginLeft: "5%", marginRight: "5%"}}>  The best way to protect your art is to give a good prompt for what you want neural networks to see. It should be completely unrelated to both your current caption and your art for best results</p>
    <p style={{textIndent: '70px', marginLeft: "5%", marginRight: "5%"}}>  <b>Is it possible for web scrapers to uncloak images?</b></p>
    <p style={{marginLeft: "5%", marginRight: "5%"}}>  Not without destroying their wallet or dataset. Adding random noise to their dataset usually doesn't work, so if they want to uncloak your art, they have to heavily blur the image. And since there's no good way for AI to determine if an image is cloaked, web scrapers would have to blur their their entire dataset, and at that point, uncloaking your art becomes more trouble than it's worth. </p>
    <p style={{textIndent: '70px', marginLeft: "5%", marginRight: "5%", marginTop:'50px'}}> <b> Does NeuralCloak work against all models?</b></p>
    <p style={{marginLeft: "5%", marginRight: "5%"}}> We are currently protecting artists from the most popular web scraping AIs, predominantly OpenAI's CLIP models. We are planning to add protection from more models. However, AI is constantly evolving, and we can't guarantee protection from any future or less popular models. </p>
